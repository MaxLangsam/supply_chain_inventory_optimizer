# Supply Chain Inventory Optimization Project

## Problem Summary
This project demonstrates a complete data analyst workflow for supply chain inventory optimization using synthetic data modeled after the M5 Forecasting dataset. The goal is to simulate realistic sales data, forecast demand, and optimize inventory levels to minimize stockouts and excess inventory.

## Key Features and Visualizations

### 1. Demand Forecasting
- **Model Comparison Plot:** Bar chart comparing MAE and RMSE across different forecasting models
  - Includes Naive, Moving Average, SARIMAX, Holt-Winters, Prophet, and XGBoost
  - Visual comparison of model performance metrics
- **Forecast Visualization:** Time series plot showing
  - Historical demand (training data)
  - Actual demand (test data)
  - Predicted demand with confidence intervals
  - Clear visualization of forecast accuracy

### 2. Inventory Simulation
- **Inventory Level Plot:** Time series visualization showing
  - Projected inventory levels
  - Reorder Point (ROP) line
  - Reorder alerts
  - Stockout events
- **Cost Analysis:** Bar chart comparing
  - Base scenario costs
  - Scenario testing costs (delay, demand surge)
  - Total Cost of Inventory (TCI) breakdown

### 3. Product Segmentation
- **Volatility Classification:** Table showing product volatility categories
  - Stable vs. volatile products
  - Risk assessment
- **Cluster Analysis:** Scatter plot showing
  - Product clusters based on demand patterns
  - Mean vs. Standard Deviation of demand
  - Color-coded clusters for easy interpretation

## Assumptions for Data Generation
- 5 unique products (`item_id`) across 2 stores (`store_id`) for better performance
- Each product belongs to one of 4 categories (`category_id`)
- Daily demand is simulated for 1 year (365 days)
- Demand patterns include:
  - Weekly seasonality
  - Random noise
  - Occasional spikes
  - Price effects
  - Weather impacts
  - Holiday effects
  - Promotion boosts

## Inventory KPIs Tracked
- **Reorder Point (ROP):** When to trigger a new order
- **Service Level:** Percentage of days with no stockouts
- **Stockout Risk:** Number of days with zero inventory
- **Forecast Accuracy:** MAE and RMSE for demand prediction
- **Total Cost of Inventory (TCI):** Combined holding, stockout, and order costs

## How to Run

1. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python -m supply_chain_inventory_optimization
